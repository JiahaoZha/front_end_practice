      <h3 id="ship_type">Ship stypes</h3>
      <p>The warships presented in the game cover periods from the early 20th century, from the dawn of dreadnought battleships to the 1950s (prior to the proliferation of guided missiles), including many ships that were planned but never put into production in real life.[16] The game features navies of major maritime powers including the United States Navy, the Imperial Japanese Navy, the British Royal Navy, the French Marine Nationale, the Imperial German Navy (later Kriegsmarine), the Italian Regia Marina and the Imperial Russian Navy (later the Red Fleet). Dutch, Commonwealth (Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Indian), Spanish, and other smaller European navies (including Swedish, Polish, Greek and Turkish) are also represented, along with a Pan-Asian tree featuring ships from various East Asian (Chinese, Taiwanese and South Korean) and Southeast Asian (Thai, Indonesian and Malaysian) navies, and a Pan-American nation featuring ships from the navies of the Latin American countries (such as Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Mexico).</p>
